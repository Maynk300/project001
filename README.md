# My First React Project – Student Management App

Hi, I’m **Mayank Saini** 
This is my very first project using **React.js**, and I created it to practice the basics of frontend development with React. It’s a simple Student Management App where you can **add**, **edit**, and **delete** student records.

While it’s a basic app, it taught me a lot about how React works, especially how to manage data and update the UI dynamically.

##  What This Project Does

- Displays a list of students
- Lets you add new students by entering their name and age
- You can edit existing records and update them
- You can delete students from the list
- There's a clear button to reset the input form
- Data is managed using `useState` and displayed in a simple table

---

##  Technologies Used

- **React.js** – For building the UI and managing state
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Core logic and interactivity
- **CSS** – Basic styling
- **VS Code + PowerShell** – My dev environment

##  What I Learned

Since this is my first project, I focused on the core concepts:

- How to use `useState` and `useEffect`
- Creating functional components
- Handling forms and user input
- Managing lists (add, update, delete)
- Basic UI logic like showing "Save" or "Update" buttons conditionally

It also helped me understand how important code structure and readability are.
